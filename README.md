# NOTE
I stopped active development of this project several months ago and as a result the plugin no longer works as intended. I would like to revist the project at some point as I still feel strongly that prominence given to statistics on Twitter skews users' experiences on the site, but am currently focusing on other work.

# noStatTwitter
Hide retweets, likes, replies and user stats from appearing in your Twitter feed

This is a simple, pure Javascript, Chrome extension that blocks Twitter from displaying statstics in your feed. It can be toggled on/off at anytime by using the the toolbar button.

At present it is still in early testing and is not available on the Chrome Web Store, howeve it can be installed by downloading the ZIP file available here and uploading it to your chrome://extension directory.
