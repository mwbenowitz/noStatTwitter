Hide retweets, likes, replies and user stats from appearing in your Twitter feed

This is a simple, pure Javascript, Chrome extension that blocks Twitter from displaying statstics in your feed. It can be toggled on/off at anytime by using the the toolbar button.

At present it is still in early testing and is not available on the Chrome Web Store, howeve it can be installed by downloading the ZIP file available here and uploading it to your chrome://extension directory.
